          Are you interested in contributing to the ZynAddSubFX project?
          There are a variety of ways that you can assist the project and many
          different skills that can be learned while contributing. You can lend
          a hand with <span class=soft>non-technical community
              interaction roles</span>,
          <span class=semi>semi-technical roles involving knowledge of synthesis
              and/or basic programming techniques</span>, or
              <span class=hard>advanced programming implementation
                  challenges/DSP design improvement roles</span>.
              The roles listed here are ordered coarsely by complexity, but don't
              let that deter you from trying out something which you want to
              learn, everyone has to start somewhere.
          <hr/><hr/>

  <h2 class=soft>Community Engagement</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_Community_168639.png"
       alt=""
       class=softi />

  <p>
  Open source isn't just about throwing software out in the open, but it's about
  the collaboration of multiple individuals to create something that would be
  difficult to build with just one individual.  Community outreach efforts
  help introduce new contributors and new users.
  If you're interested in trying to get new individuals interested in
  contributing and making things run more smoothly for existing contributors,
  then it would be great to have some assistance.
  For example, creating pages like the one you're reading can be used to gain
  new interest or writing summaries about new features.</p>

  <h4>How to get started</h4>
  <p>
  There's no one right approach to how to build a community, so the first step
  should be a discussion.
  I'd recommend proposing an idea via IRC (#zynaddsubfx on irc.libera.chat) or the community
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-ml')" href= "http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/zynaddsubfx-user">mailing list</a>
  to get the dialog started.
  </p>

  <h2 class=soft>Multi-Platform Testing</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_testing_1914762.png"
       alt="testing by QualityIcons from the Noun Project"
       class=softi />

  <p>
  ZynAddSubFX (and Zyn-Fusion) run on Linux, OSX, Window, and BSD with platforms
  ranging between x86, x86_64, ARM, etc. So, there's a lot of different places
  where bugs can creep in.
  It's difficult to keep track of where errors can occur, when they have been
  introduced, and when they have been fixed.
  If you're interested in helping test a particular platform regularly, then
  please chime in to help make Zyn more stable, performant, and fun to use on your
  platform of choice.
  If you are familiar with debugging tools on your platform, that's a plus, but
  not strictly required.
  </p>

  <h2 class=soft>Bug Reporting and Managment</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_Bug_564413.png"
       alt="Bug by Hea Poh Lin from the Noun Project"
       class=softi />

  <p>ZynAddSubFX has a large community across multiple websites. As such it can
  be tricky to keep track of all bugs, feature requests, and support requests.
  If you're interested in lending a hand towards the organization of these
  issues it would be appreciated.
  No technical experience needed.</p>

  <h4>How to get started</h4>
  <p>
  If you're interested in helping to report bugs, tag them, respond to inquires,
  and organize them so other contributors can efficiently navigate them, please
  inquire on the IRC channel for zyn (#zynaddsubfx on irc.libera.chat).
  </p>

  <h2 class=semi>Documentation</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_documentation_884660.png"
       alt="documentation by shashank singh from the Noun Project"
       class=semii />
  <p>Open source documentation doesn't always cover the topics you're looking
  for quite in enough depth or breath and Zyn is no exception. Features are
  constantly getting added and the interface has recently undergone a major
  overhaul. As such there are plenty of gaps which need filling.
  While Zyn does have a spread of existing documentation, new efforts are being
  focused on a new user focused manual available at <a
  href=https://github.com/zynaddsubfx/user-manual>https://github.com/zynaddsubfx/user-manual</a>
  .
  </p>

  <p>
  The goal is to provide users with something that goes beyond what the features
  are in Zyn and to talk about how to use them to solve practical sound design
  challenges.
  The overall architecting of this work is being lead by unfa, but there is a
  huge amount of work involved in going from the provided outline to a full and
  easy to follow guide through ZynAddSubFX.</p>
  <h4>How to get started?</h4>
  <p>I'd recommend reading through the current outline on github and seeing what
  gaps exist. Old documentation can be ported over fairly simply as long as it
  fits the new flow though the document, so both beginner technical writers as
  well as advanced zyn users should feel comfortable taking steps to make the
  manual a more complete guide. </p>

  <h2 class=soft>Translations</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_Language_1485724.png"
       alt=""
       width=220px
       style="float:left"/>
  <p>While the infrastructure in Zyn-Fusion is still just beginning to support
  translations to different languages, it is a target of the application.
  Translations can help make synthesis more approachable and help in these
  efforts would be appreciated.</p>-->

  <h2 class=semi>User Interface Programming and Refinement</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_synth_203861.png"
       alt=""
       class=semii />

  <p>
  Looking to leave a visual mark on the synth?
  The Zyn UI is a large one with many places which can be improved by new
  contributors.
  Since synthesizer interfaces have unique requirements (see LAC 2018
  presentation on MRuby-Zest), Zyn does not use a traditional user interface
  toolkit, but uses one where the majority of code is in Ruby.
  As long as you're familiar with Ruby or another high level scripting language,
  it should not be too difficult to pick up.
  </p>

  <h4>How to get started</h4>
  <p>

  To start out, the MRuby-Zest user interface improvements is based off the
  designs provided by <a href="mockup-2016/index.html">a set of mockups by
      Budislav</a> <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/38595019/Zyn-UIUX-Design-Concept-Fusion">(current
                           profile)</a>.
  You can look at the mockups to understand how the current implementation
  deviates from the original design and you can find issues on the user
  interface on <a href="https://github.com/zynaddsubfx/zyn-fusion-issues/">the
      github issue tracker</a>.
  For more hands on guidance don't feel afraid to join the IRC
  channel(#zynaddsubfx on irc.libera.chat), use the
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-ml')" href= "http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/zynaddsubfx-user">mailing list</a>
  , or start discussions on relevant issue threads.
  </p>



  <h2 class=semi>General Programming</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_programming_1677970.png"
       alt=""
       class=semii />
  <p style="float:none">
  Like most open source projects the Zyn team loves to see interested developers help out.
  Within ZynAddSubFX you'll see a mixture of C, C++, and Ruby (for the UI).
  For many tasks you'll only need basic knowledge of any one language to get
  started.
  </p>
  <h4>How to get started</h4>
  <p>
  If you're interested in helping out coding we recommend checking out the issue trackers for
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-bugs')" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/zynaddsubfx/bugs/">bugs</a>,
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-features')" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/zynaddsubfx/feature-requests/">features</a>, and
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-patches')" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/zynaddsubfx/patches/">patches</a>.
  There you should be able to find some issues marked 'beginner'.
  These issues should involve relatively few different source files and ideally
  it should be possible to finish them in a single sitting.
  Resulting changes should be contributed back through either the patch tracker
  or via a git pull request.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you're trying to figure out more details, please feel free to hop onto the
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-ml')" href= "http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/zynaddsubfx-user">mailing list</a>
  or into the community IRC channel (#zynaddsubfx on irc.libera.chat) to talk with other
  contributors.

  <h2 class=semi>Instrument Design and Refinement</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_Keyboard_933062.png"
       alt="Keyboard by Olivier Guillard from the Noun Project"
       class=semii />

  <p>People are always looking for new instruments to experiment with.
  For a one-off instrument <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-ma')" href="https://musical-artifacts.com/">musical
      artifacts</a> hosts individual instruments for a variety of open source
  synths and effects. For larger collections of patches they can be shared via
  the
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-ml')" href= "http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/zynaddsubfx-user">mailing list</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class=hard>Digital Signal Processing</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_Fourier%20transformation_221517.png"
       alt="Fourier transformation by Aenne Brielmann from the Noun Project"
       class=hardi />

  <p>
  Are you interested in the math behind the music?
  In order to synthesize audio as well as manipulate existing audio streams
  ZynAddSubFX involves a fair amount of signal processing.
  The DSP involved varies from Fourier transforms, to filter banks, to simple
  waveform generation.
  If you want to help improve the current DSP under the hood or just generally
  learn about what happens in the domain of realtime audio, then contributing on
  this front should be a fun exercise.
  </p>

  <h4>How to get started</h4>
  <p>
  Ideally to approach DSP level problems you should have some basic level of
  familiarity with C++, a prototyping language (Python/Julia/MATLAB/R), and some
  experience with vector mathematics, but there will be opportunities to learn
  when getting started.
  If you have a particular idea in mind, then check the feature trackers to see
  if there is prior work on your particular idea.
  Otherwise, try joining the
  <a onclick="trackContrib('contrib-ml')" href= "http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/zynaddsubfx-user">mailing list</a>
  and IRC channel (#zynaddsubfx on irc.libera.chat) and get the conversation started.
  </p>

  <h2 class=hard>Realtime System Level Programming</h2>
  <img src="nouns/noun_programming_1677970.png"
       alt=""
       class=hardi />

  <p>
  Do you want to understand how audio can be produced in a multi-threaded
  low latency context reliably?
  Do you want to write optimized mathematical routines, lock-free threading
  communication mechanisms, draw out diagrams walking through asynchronous
  program execution, or write embedded code?</p>

  <p>Well, within low latency audio processing tools, you'll see some of all of
  these concepts.
  Creating reliable low-latency, high throughput code which is easy for users
  to control is <b>hard</b>.
  It involves a lot of pencil and paper work to establish designs and a fair
  amount of programming time to implement the designs in ways that they're hard
  to mistakenly break.
  </p>

  <h4>How to get started</h4>
  <p>
  Ideally if you want to get into this level you'll have a strong grasp of low
  level machine implementation details, such as cache behavior, x86 memory
  reordering, lock free primitives, the general C/C++ memory model, JACK,
  assembly, and programming constraints on small embedded devices.
  If you want to be involved in this role it's a natural extension of general
  programming.
  To get started there will need to be some direct discussion between yourself
  an other long term developers.

  <h2>Donations</h2>
  <p>
  Any donations are appreciated and they're currently accepted by two
  developers.
  The project was started in March 2002 by <a onclick="trackContrib('outbound-pn')" href="http://www.paulnasca.com">Nasca Octavian Paul</a>.
  He began to write ZynAddSubFX in order to create a synthesizer
  which could produce beautiful sounds, while being freely available to
  anybody who needs it.
  Since 2009, ZynAddSubFX has been lead by <a onclick="trackContrib('outbound-fc')" href="http://fundamental-code.com">Mark McCurry</a>.
  In these few years some major architectural changes have been brought about
  which culminated in the 3.0.0 UI rewrite release.</p>
